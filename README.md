Django excercise - CRUD with class based views. User can add items to a list (tables - furniture), then user can read the list, update or delete selected item.

User needs to be logged in in order to make changes (create new record, update record or delete record / login: "adam" pw: 1234).

If not logged - one can only see a table with data.
